Thermal Calculator for Electronic Components

This useful Python TK GUI generates a thermal profile for components as a function of voltage drop across component, measured current, RTheta, ambient temp, and max temp.
It can be used for quick thermal profiling of most components.

As always, I may change this code without warning!
