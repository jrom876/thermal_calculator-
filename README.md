Thermal Stress Profiler GUI for Electronic Components

This useful Python TK GUI generates a thermal profile for components as a function of standard datasheet values such as: voltage drop, measured current, RTheta, ambient temp, and max temp of component.

It is intended for quick thermal profiling of most electronic components using values from the datasheet.
